??? note "If the password for the mailing mailbox changes..."

    If the password for the mailing mailbox changes, you need to update the EMAIL_PASS 
    variable located in the .env file on the server. Additionally, on the dev server, this file 
    contains the LM_EMAIL, TM_EMAIL, and PM_EMAIL variables, which specify the email addresses
    to which mailings from the dev server will be sent.
